#Simple Song
I've been a fan of [The Shins](http://theshins.com) for years. Their last album, [Wincing The Night Away](http://open.spotify.com/album/3iV8OKGjejtOqGWwpUgXFC "Listen to 'Wincing The Night Away' on Spotify"), released in 2007, was great and I've been looking forward to hear something new from them ever since.

At last there seems to be a new album on the horizon. The single [Simple Song](http://open.spotify.com/album/3eZ5XAIiBlF5GcEq01jrWf) was just released on [Spotify](http://spotify.com) and it sounds awesome. According to their [redesigned website](http://theshins.com) the album, "Port Of Tomorrow", is going to be available March 20th.

Can't wait.
