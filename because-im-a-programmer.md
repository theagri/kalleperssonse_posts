#Because I'm a programmer

[Marco Arment](http://marco.org), in the [README for his Second Crack project](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack/blob/master/README.markdown), answering "_So why did you make this?_":

> Because I'm a programmer, and this is what I do.

> Some people jog away from their house every day, only to jog back. Others walk on a treadmill, expending energy to get nowhere. In both cases, it may appear to others that they've accomplished nothing, but they've chosen to do these seemingly redundant activities on a regular basis to incrementally improve themselves. And it works.

Inspirational. Also, I am glad to finally be able to peek at the [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack) source.
