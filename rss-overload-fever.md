#Why RSS Feed overload sucks and how Fever solves it by being awesome

If you haven't already, check out [Shaun Inman](http://shauninman.com)'s [Fever web application](http://feedafever.com). It's been around for quite a while (2008 I think). It solves the RSS information overload you, me and probably a bunch 
of other people "suffer" form.

While [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com) is a good platform and [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) is an great interface for it, their main task is to show you the RSS feeds you subscribe to - and when your application looks like mine when you haven't used it for about a week, it's not even funny.

If you're anything like me, this will trigger some kind of urge to reach RSS [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/), which makes it no longer a pleasure but rather some kind of chore you must do every day to keep your RSS reader tidy.

Even worse, if you've got the icon badge enabled you now have an angry **3081** screaming for attention. Good luck with getting any work done.

For me, [Fever](http://feedafever.com) solves this problem.

It analyzes your incoming RSS feeds, measuring the amount of links they get from your *other* feeds to see how popular they might be. These feed items are placed in a special "Hot" category, which is sorted by poularity. This makes it really nice to quickly dive in, read the 10 or 20 most interesting stories today.

Fever also comes with another smart category called "Kindling", in which you add feeds you just can't miss like friends' blogs and similiar stuff. You just have to be careful about what you add here.

Since you host Fever on your own server, it also gives you that nice feeling of owning your data - if you care about that.
