#This is SJEUGAM
It's almost a luxury being able to write software for yourself. You get to control every aspect of it and you're able to adjust the entire workflow with how you want to work.

The site you're reading this entry on uses my self-written tiny static blogging engine that uses Markdown for formatting and Git for fetching entries from your computer. I finally got some time to clean up and push the source of this simple blogging engine to github. 

The name is an abbreviation of "*Static Journal Engine Using Git And Markdown*". I had to call it something :)

At the moment it's a bit of a hassle to set up. It needs a non-included rewrite rule for the paths to work and I also haven't included the cron script that fetches new entries over git and updates the cache. Finally, there is zero documentation. With some luck, I'll get time to fix all of this soon(ish).

Feedback, be it [bugs](https://github.com/kallepersson/sjeugam/issues) or [anything else](http://twitter.com/kallepersson), is of course much appreciated.
